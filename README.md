Creating a flash card is easy! All you do is put your "prompt" for the topic you want to quiz yourself on and then put the content into the "answer" field. Then click Submit and then voila, you have officially added a new flash card to your study pile.

Each flash card looks like this on your brower. To quiz yourself simply answer the prompt verbally and then click "answer" to see if you were right! To navigate to other flash cards in your pile simply using the "previous" and "next" arrows to navigate. Don't worry, you will only navigate to other prompts and will not cheat by seeing the answers!
